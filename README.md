# Links
## Writing Links
### Links are created using the < a > element. Users can click on anything between the opening < a > tag and the closing < /a > tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Email Links
### (mailto:): To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the < a > element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
